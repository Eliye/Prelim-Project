                <h3>FEED THE STARVING CAMPAIGN</h3>
                <p>Almost thousands people in the Philippines face hunger and malnutrition. Some experience seasonal hunger and malnourishment, and poor diets high in cheap, processed foods are leading to a rise of diseases. At the same time, thousands of people living in hard to reach areas are not given much attention about their health. Those hard to reach areas have most people who lack nutrients in their body. Volunteers around the country aim to feed the starving and attain proper health by giving a whole month supply of food. After a month of supply, volunteers are to go back to these areas and check if the health status of the community have improved.</p>
