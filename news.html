							<h3>NEW PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT HOPES TO ERADICATE ILLEGAL DRUGS AND CRIMES</h3>
                            <p>After winning landslide election, President Rodrigo Duterte’s first agenda is to eliminate drug lords and drug mules. Crime rates in the Philippines is continuously increasing due to drugs. President Duterte thinks that the root of all crimes happening is because of illegal drugs. Duterte now giving orders to the Philippine National Police to hunt down each and every drug user, dealer and seller here in the Philippines. General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa the PNP Chief Police Director heads the police on this campaign against drugs. To achive peace and order, “Oplan Tokhang” is launched. “Tokhang” meaning to plead and talk, house to house, to drug users and pushers to stop what they are doing and to give warning on what may happen to them if they resist and continue their bad doings. With only President Duterte being elected after 7 months, death tolls among drug users are over 7,000. The “War on Drugs” both from legitimate police and vigilante-styles have caused 7,080 total number of people killed since July 1, 2016. 2,555 are drug personalities or in the drug watch list that were killed. 3,603 victims are still under investigation. Over a million drug users and pushers voluntarily turned themselves to the police within 7 months. The PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG) was also involved in this so called War on Drugs.</p>

                            <h3>EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS OR STILL WAR ON DRUGS?</h3>
                            <p>With more than 7,000 drug related killings, President Duterte is now held of endorsing extrajudicial killings. Nowadays we have that people being killed with cardboards saying “Drug pusher ako, huwag tularan.” Activists, suspected drug users and dealers are subject to public vilification through “Oplan Tokhang.” They are forced into surrendering and admitting guilt because police and barangay officials are telling them that they are on the drug watch lists. Many of those who surrendered have been subjected to vigilante killings. Police say the killings are part of the drug syndicates’ effort to cleanse its ranks that is to avoid them being caught and pointed at by their fellow members. Human Rights groups and foreign leaders are now concerned with Duterte’s way of eradicating crime. They think that Duterte encourages people to kill other people. People are now questioning if this war on drugs enhances peace and order, or is only making it worse. Duterte’s statement says “They kill each other, better. Criminals kill criminals that is not my worry”.</p>

                            <h3>DUTERTE ADMINISTRATION ON SAVING STREET CHILDREN</h3>
                            <p>Estimated 300,000 street children are in the Philippines. After winning the election President Duterte’s plans include curfew for minors and trying parents whose kids are on the streets. Police all over the Philippines started catching minors and homeless families on the streets. Minors who are drinking beyond 10 in the evening are being brought to police stations and are being advised not to repeat it again. Minors who are playing around while cars are on the road are also being captured by police, looking for their parents and giving them advices to keep their children out of the streets. Laws about children in the Philippines shows the tendency to depict street children as a group of children who are a threat to society simply by being on the streets.</p>
                            <br> 
                            <p>Children should not be on the street, they should have proper education. The Department of Social and Welfare Development (DSWD) implemented a program dubbed as “Sagip Kalinga. The objectives are to prevent the increase of street dwellers, including street children, and to protect them from the hazards of street life. Giving them proper education that being in the streets are dangerous. DSWD encourages Netizens to give information on street children’s whereabouts so the department can rescue them.</p>
